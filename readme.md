Challenge: Given 10 numbers, print the largest consecutive order it contains and mention its nature (increasing / decreasing).

My Solution:

I. Scan 10 numbers as input from the user.

II. Define a structure whose members can contains the state of a pattern.

III. Declare two arrays of above structure, one to capture increment trends and the other to capture decrement trends.

IV. Go in a while loop through the array, and capture the start and end indices of the increment/decrement patterns. More than one increment patterns can be stored in different array elements of the increment structure array (same for decrement structure array).

V. After that go in a loop to determine maximum trend lenght between incremement and decrement trends, with that capture the index (i_num, d_num) of the structure array that has the max length.

VI. Print the largest trend and its nature on the output screen.
